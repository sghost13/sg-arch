#### TO CHANGE THEMES UNCOMMENT ONE OF THE THEMES AT END OF FILE

#: Color scheme {{{

background_opacity 0.6

#: The opacity of the background. A number between zero and one, where
#: one is opaque and zero is fully transparent. This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background, so that things like the status bar in vim, powerline
#: prompts, etc. still look good. But it means that if you use a color
#: theme with a background color in your editor, it will not be
#: rendered as transparent. Instead you should change the default
#: background color in your kitty config and not use a background
#: color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape codes to set
#: the terminals default colors in a shell script to launch your
#: editor. Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly
#: significant) performance hit. If you want to dynamically change
#: transparency of windows, set dynamic_background_opacity to yes
#: (this is off by default as it has a performance cost). Changing
#: this option when reloading the config will only work if
#: dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the original config.

background_image none

#: Path to a background image. Must be in PNG format.

background_image_layout tiled

#: Whether to tile, scale or clamp the background image. The value can
#: be one of tiled, mirror-tiled, scaled, clamped or centered.

background_image_linear no

#: When background image is scaled, whether linear interpolation
#: should be used.

dynamic_background_opacity no

#: Allow changing of the background_opacity dynamically, using either
#: keyboard shortcuts (increase_background_opacity and
#: decrease_background_opacity) or the remote control facility.
#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

background_tint 0.0

#: How much to tint the background image by the background color. This
#: option makes it easier to read the text. Tinting is done using the
#: current background color for each window. This option applies only
#: if background_opacity is set and transparent windows are supported
#: or background_image is set.

background_tint_gaps 1.0

#: How much to tint the background image at the window gaps by the
#: background color, after applying background_tint. Since this is
#: multiplicative with background_tint, it can be used to lighten the
#: tint over the window gaps for a *separated* look.

dim_opacity 0.75

#: How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One
#: means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).



#: The color table {{{

#: The 256 terminal colors. There are 8 basic colors, each color has a
#: dull and bright version, for the first 16 colors. You can set the
#: remaining 240 colors as color16 to color255.
