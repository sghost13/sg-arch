# This section is for changing the COLORS used in Amfora.
# These colors only apply if 'color' is enabled above.
# Colors can be set using a W3C color name, or a hex value such as "#ffffff".

# Note that not all colors will work on terminals that do not have truecolor support.
# If you want to stick to the standard 16 or 256 colors, you can get
# a list of those here: https://jonasjacek.github.io/colors/
# DO NOT use the names from that site, just the hex codes.
